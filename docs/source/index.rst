Welcome to Savant documentation!
================================

Savant is a Python/C++ video analytics framework that helps building complex pipelines easily, leveraging optimized video processing and deep learning model inference capabilities of Gstreamer multimedia framework and NVIDIA Deepstream to provide fast performance.

With Savant deploying your models in an efficient pipeline can be as simple as writing a YAML configuration file, and custom model pre- and post-processing code integration is straightforward both for Python and C++.

Savant supports discrete NVIDIA GPU and NVIDIA Jetson platforms.
